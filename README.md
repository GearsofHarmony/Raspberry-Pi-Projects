# BME280 Environment Sensor
This project written in python contains two seperate scripts. The bme280-test.py script reads from the sensor every minute for 15 minutes and outputs the data into a file. The read_bme280_data.py script reads from the output file generated from the test script and saves a generated line graph image into a png file.
